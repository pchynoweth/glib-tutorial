# Lesson 7: Asynchronous Operations

## Overview

This lesson expands on async operations, showing patterns for real-world scenarios like file I/O, network operations, and coordinating multiple async tasks.

## Key Concepts

- Async I/O with GIO
- Chaining asynchronous operations
- Handling multiple concurrent operations
- Error propagation in async contexts
- Async/await patterns in C

## Examples

This lesson builds on Lesson 6's GTask foundation. Key patterns include:
- Sequential async operations
- Parallel async operations
- Error handling across async boundaries
- Timeouts and cancellation

## Building Examples

```bash
make
```

## Next Steps

Move to Lesson 8 for advanced topics including custom data structures, serialization, and optimization!
